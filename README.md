#Getting and Cleaning Data Course Projectless 
The purpose of this project is to  submit Cleaning Data Course Projectless  in week4 by using
This data as below:

https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip

I create one R script called run_analysis.R that does the following.

1 Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2 Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3 Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4 Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
5 From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
